# PiEEG-16
Measure 16 EEG channels with Shield PiEEG-16 and RaspberryPi

Connect PiEEG-16 and just launch the [script](https://github.com/pieeg-club/PiEEG-16/blob/main/GUI/1.Graph.Py) for graph visualization in real-time and the [script](https://github.com/pieeg-club/PiEEG-16/blob/main/Save_data/1.Save_Data.py) to save data.   
and [script](https://github.com/pieeg-club/PiEEG-16/blob/main/Save_data/2.Data_Vis_Graph_All_in_one.py ) for graph visualization   


This project is the result of several years of work on the development of BCI. We believe that the easiest way to get started with biosignals is to use a shield. We will try to reveal the process of reading EEG signals as fully and clearly as possible.
